          ChainPay.Creditcard explains what happens when a “blockchain payment card” is used at a normal terminal:
          how on-chain balances are bridged to fiat, where stablecoins fit in, and which parts still run on traditional card rails.

    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Chain-Based Payment Card?</h2>
      <p>
        A chain-based payment card links a standard network card to a wallet, exchange or on-chain balance. Instead of
        drawing funds from a bank account, the programme monitors assets on one or more blockchains and uses those assets
        to fund fiat settlements when the card is used.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the merchant side, nothing special is required: the terminal sends a normal card authorisation. All blockchain
        interaction happens on the issuer or partner platform, which manages wallets, conversions and settlement flows in
        the background.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Funds Move From Chain to Card Network</h2>
      <p>
        When you pay with a ChainPay-style card, the issuer or programme operator first checks a linked wallet or
        off-chain ledger that tracks your on-chain assets. Depending on the setup, it may:
      </p>
      <p>
        • lock a portion of your balance,  
        • convert stablecoins or tokens into fiat at a partner exchange, or  
        • draw on a prefunded fiat pool that is periodically rebalanced from blockchain holdings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The card network only sees a fiat authorisation request. The bridge between chain and card rails is handled by
        the programme’s internal treasury and settlement logic.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Stablecoins, Layers and “On-Chain” Marketing Claims</h2>
      <p>
        Many products advertised as “on-chain cards” actually rely heavily on stablecoins and internal ledgers. Assets
        may move on a public blockchain at deposit and withdrawal, but day-to-day card spend is usually netted and
        settled off-chain to keep costs predictable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Layer 2 networks and sidechains can be used to reduce fees or increase speed, but from a cardholder perspective
        the critical questions are the same: who is the counterparty, how is value preserved, and at which points are
        you exposed to volatility or protocol risk.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Fees, Spreads and Bridge Risks</h2>
      <p>
        Chain-based cards introduce an extra bridge between assets and spending currency. Each bridge can involve spreads,
        network fees and service charges that sit on top of any standard card fees and FX margins.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand the real cost of a ChainPay-style programme, look at:  
        • deposit and withdrawal fees for moving funds on- and off-chain,  
        • conversion spreads when exchanging tokens or stablecoins, and  
        • card-level fees such as FX margins, ATM charges and inactivity fees.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Regulation, Safeguarding and Tax Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on jurisdiction, the entity operating the on/off-ramp may need authorisations as an e-money issuer,
        payment institution or crypto-asset service provider. The degree of safeguarding, segregation of client funds and
        complaint handling processes can vary widely.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a tax perspective, converting tokens or stablecoins into fiat may trigger disposals. Using a chain-linked
        card for everyday purchases can generate a large volume of small events, which makes exportable histories and
        robust reporting tools important if you plan to rely on this for regular spending.
